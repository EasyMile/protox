* TODO.
- Size in the output of encode {len, iolist}?
- parse .proto
  * call `protoc foo.proto -o foo.bin` from Elixir
- Take a look at https://github.com/rrrene/inch_ex and https://ebertapp.io
- Check for duplicate entries (names or tags) in definitions


* Optimize
- Metaprog decoder?


* Conformance
-  "If there is an unknown enum value in the wire format of a map entry message, it's handled differently in proto2 and proto3. In proto2, the whole map entry message is put into the unknown field set of the containing message. In proto3, it is put into a map field as if it is a known enum value."
